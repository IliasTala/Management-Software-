# HELB_ELECTRO
JavaFX Management App

## DESCRIPTION

I developed an automated warehouse simulation application using JavaFX. 
The objective of this application was to allow the implementation of different types of products and components that can interact with each other in order to recreate a system of manufacturing of products from components, as well as a system of sales and statistics.
